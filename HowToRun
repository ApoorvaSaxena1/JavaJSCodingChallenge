The UI folder contains three html files which implement the following functionalities:
1) JQXGrid.htm: JQXGrid with sorting and filtering
2) ChartJS.htm: Pie charts using Chart.js
3) Server-side Paging.htm: JQXGrid with serer side paging

Since these are static HTML pages, to test the pages we need to run the Chrome Browser without CORS security:


For Windows, run chrome without CORS security using following command on cmd:
{Path to chrome.exe}/chrome.exe --disable-web-security

For other OS, please click on the link and follow the instaructions based on your OS:

After starting the browser, run the three pages.

Both the Spring Java Rest API and MySQL Database has been deployed on AWS EC2 and RDS respectively.
